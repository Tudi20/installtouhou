# How to install Touhou with English patches
## Acquire the Games
You can acquire the games from:
 * [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=%E4%B8%8A%E6%B5%B7%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B9%E5%B9%BB%E6%A8%82%E5%9B%A3) (Not recommended due to Steam DRM sometimes present)
 * [DLSite](https://www.dlsite.com/home/dlaf/=/aid/tudi20/url/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dlsite.com%2Feng%2F%3Futm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dbnlink%26utm_content%3Dtext) (Affliaite Link)
 * Piracy sites (recommended getting one with pre-packed with thpatch then)
## Installing thcrap
 * Go to your installation for Steam, right-click on your game in the client, select Manage and the Browse local files. On the others wherever you selected to download/install the game.
 * If you see a thcrap folder you can skip the below test, and hopefully everything works!
 * Download [THCRAP](https://www.thpatch.net/wiki/Touhou_Patch_Center:Download), extract it.
 * Run `thcrap-configure.exe`
## Installing the English patch
 * After clicking Next and it downloading a few files; scroll up and double click on `lang_en`. Click Next.
 * Wait for it to download stuff again >.<.
 * Just accept the default name aka click Next.
 * Next again, and again. _We rdo really need a new GUI..._
 * Select your Touhou folder in the popped up browser picker.
 
   **If you have multiple Touhou games, select the folder that contains all of them!**
 * After this, grab the right side of the window and extend it, and click on the not `(not recommended)` ones. (**That was double negation!**)
 * After done, click yes.
 * Wait till it downloads the patches. Grab a coffee, if something goes wrong somewhere yu might be pulling all-nighter >.<.
 * Click next. You're done!
 * Go click on one of the shortcuts it createdand have a go! If you don't like shortcuts, check out the next section:
## Optional: Get Universal THCRAP Launcher or UTL for short
 * Go to [this page](https://github.com/thpatch/Universal-THCRAP-Launcher/releases) and download `utl.rar`.
 * Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/thpatch/Universal-THCRAP-Launcher#installation).
